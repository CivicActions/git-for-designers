## Forking a repo on GitHub

Task: Fork a repo so you can work on it separately.

1. Log in to GitHub: [/login](https://github.com/login)

2. Visit the repo you want to fork, e.g. [/CivicActions/git-for-designers](https://github.com/CivicActions/git-for-designers)

3. Look to the right of the repo name, or just below it on small screens, and click the **Fork** action.

4. On the **Create a new fork** page, make sure your name is selected then click **Create fork**.

5. After a few seconds your forked repo will load at **/\<your-username\>/git-for-designers**.

You now have a forked repo that is a copy of the original. You might be tempted to get to work on changing files, but there is one more step before we do that.

## Creating a branch on GitHub

Task: Create a separate branch to make your changes in.

1. Visit your forked repo at **/\<your-username\>/git-for-designers**

2. Notice the button labeled **main** below the name of your repo at the upper left of screen.

3. Click the **1 Branch** link to the right of the **main** button.

4. Click **New branch**.

5. Provide a name using lowercase letters and hyphens between words, e.g. **my-first-branch**.

6. Click **Create new branch**.

7. Notice that the Branches page now has headings for:

	- *Default* (listing **main**), 
	- *Your branches* (listing **my-first-branch**), and 
	- *Active branches* (listing **my-first-branch**).

8. Select either **my-first-branch** link to make it active.

You have now prepared your repo for editing.
