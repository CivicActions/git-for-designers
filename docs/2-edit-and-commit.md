‚ö†Ô∏è Document status: **Draft**

## Create a new branch

*Task: Work in a new branch of your fork (not the original, and not your fork‚Äôs main branch):*

1. Visit your forked repo at `/<your-username>/<project-name>`.
2. [Create a new branch](1-fork-and-branch.md) and switch to it.

## Make changes and commit them

### Make changes using the basic editor

*Task: Edit a file in place within the GitHub user interface.*

Complete steps 1 and 2 above, then:

3. Navigate to a file you want to edit.
4. Click the **Edit** button or click the **‚Üì (More edit options)** down arrow and choose **Edit in place**
5. Your file opens the basic editor within the GitHub UI.
6. Make changes to your file.
7. Save your changes by clicking the **Commit changes‚Ä¶** button and providing a commit message.
8. If you have configured more than one email address with GitHub, select the one to associate with the commit 
9. Click the **Commit changes** button.

This approach is fast and works well for simple changes.

### Makes changes using the online code editor

*Task: Open the file in **github.dev** to use an editor with more features.*

Complete steps 1 and 2 above, then:

3. Navigate to a file you want to edit.
4. Click the **‚Üì (More edit options)** down arrow and choose **Open with github.dev**
5. Your browser context changes to github.dev which loads a version of VS Code. You are placed in **Explorer** view showing your project‚Äôs files on the left and an open tab for your document.
6. Edit your file (changes are saved as you type).
7. You can open other files and edit them too.
8. **Source Control** view tracks how many files have changed with a blue notification count badge. Click the icon with the badge to switch to this view.
9. Enter a commit message at the top of the left column then click **Commit & Push** your changes.
10. All of your changed files are pushed to the active branch on GitHub.
11. Click the hamburger menu above the Explorer icon and select **Go to repository** to return to the GitHub UI.

The **github.dev** editor is similar to the experience of editing on your local machine except that changes are automatically saved as you type.
